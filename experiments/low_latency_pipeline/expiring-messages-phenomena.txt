ok - i ll try that next, but first I have a question.

let's assume what you are saying is correct and that the producer only has a capacity of 10 req/s. 
isn't the producer throttling itself? doesn't the produce wait for messages to be delivered before 
he buffers new requests? it would seem like the producer just buffers in the RecordAccumulator at 
full speed without being able to deliver, correct?



Short answer: yes—your intuition is right.
	•	The Kafka producer is async. send() enqueues to the RecordAccumulator and returns immediately. It does not wait for delivery unless it runs out of buffer.
	•	A background Sender thread drains batches and keeps up to max.in.flight.requests.per.connection in flight per broker connection. When those are full, extra records just queue in the accumulator.
	•	The only hard backpressure is buffer.memory: if it fills, send() blocks (up to max.block.ms) or throws BufferExhaustedException. Otherwise the app can keep enqueueing.
	•	As acks take ~500 ms and in-flight is capped, the queue grows; the oldest batches sit long enough that delivery.timeout.ms is hit and they expire → the exact timeouts you’re seeing.

If you want to see this on the producer, watch:
	•	requests-in-flight (should sit near the cap),
	•	record-queue-time-avg/max (should climb),
	•	batch-size-avg and records-per-request-avg (likely small with linger.ms=0),
	•	buffer-available-bytes / buffer wait metrics (to confirm you’re not buffer-exhausted).

Bigger batches (batch.size up, add linger.ms) = fewer requests/sec → fits within the in-flight/ack cadence and stops the expiries.
